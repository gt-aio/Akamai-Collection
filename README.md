# Akamai Collection

## Collect data needed by Akamai

### Getting Started

Just make sure you have typescript installed on your machine to compile to js, then `tsc` to build and open the index.html script.

### Todo

- Analyze and improve data harvested
- Integrate with API(I have this code already, I may add it upon request)
- further html file to include any other cases included in akamai
